# Project Title
Predicting Booking Cancellation for a Hotel

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of booking cancellation for a hotel reservation. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the probability of a booking being canceled based on various features and attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of a collection of hotel reservations, along with relevant information such as booking dates, customer details, room type, and other features that can potentially influence the cancellation decision.

## Requirements
The following libraries and tools are required to run this project:

- R (Version 4.2.x)
- R Markdown
- skimr
- ggplot2
- scales
- gridExtra
- waffle
- dplyr
- reshape2
- caret
- rpart
- rpart.plot
- randomForest


## Methodology
The project involves several steps to predict booking cancellation:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A thorough analysis of the dataset is conducted to gain insights into the distribution, patterns, and relationships among different variables. Visualization techniques are employed to visualize the data and identify key factors that might influence booking cancellations.

Feature Engineering: Based on the insights gained from EDA, relevant features are selected or created to improve the predictive power of the model. This may involve transforming variables, creating new variables, or selecting subsets of the available data.

Modeling: Various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, or other suitable models, are trained and evaluated using the dataset. The performance of different models is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy.

Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess their predictive performance. This step helps determine the model's ability to generalize to unseen data and predict booking cancellations accurately.

## Results
The project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing booking cancellation for hotel reservations. Through exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling, the project strives to identify key features that contribute to cancellations and develop a reliable model for predicting cancellation probabilities.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project focuses on predicting booking cancellation for a hotel reservation. By analyzing the dataset and developing a machine learning model, we aim to gain valuable insights into the factors influencing cancellation decisions. The findings from this project can assist hotel management in making informed decisions, optimizing resource allocation, and improving customer satisfaction.
